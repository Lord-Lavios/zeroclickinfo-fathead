iMac (21.5-inch, Late 2013) Upgrade decision	A										<section class="prog__container"><p>Your iMac is the last 21.5 with actual slots for ram,<strong> but</strong>, they&apos;re on the backside of the logic board requiring <strong>complete</strong> disassembly. You&apos;re also limited to maximum of 16gb of ram. An SSD as opposed to the slow spinning hard drive would speed some things up but IMO still won&apos;t be enough for the task you suggest. Your best bet would be to sell your iMac and use the proceeds and the money you would invest in upgrades to buy a better equipped iMac. Stay away ftom 21.5&quot; models unless you can afford the top of the line.</p></section>	https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7933082#thread-message-31668991

In that case, LOOKUP (and VLOOKUP or MATCH, when not set to require an exact match) will take the &apos;close&apos; match and return what could be a wrong value.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Barry</p></section>	https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7931704#thread-message-31665839

A new Bug or a New Feature? The "x" on Faces Circles is Missing in Photos on macOS 10.12.4	A										<section class="prog__container"><p>I have also &quot;lost&quot; the X on the face circle. Saw this already in the beta versions of 10.12.4.</p><p>Very annoying, as it breaks my workflow of putting names on people.</p><p>I usually import photos, put them in an album (one for each event) and remove the unwanted photos.</p><p>Then wait 1 or two days for the scanning to do its job.</p><p>Then open the new album, and name all circles which haven&apos;t been named automatically.</p><p>I also add the missing circles (faces not recognized).</p><p>And I removed all unwanted faces with the X.</p><p>From time to time I go to the people albums and click &quot;+&quot; to check the recognized but not named faces.</p><p>There I see many empty/gray rectangles of the faces that I got ride of by clicking &quot;X&quot;.</p><p>Between these I see some other to-be-named faces that I have missed above. I add them to the view of people albums and name them.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>As I cannot remove faces anymore using &quot;x&quot;, the view with the list of recognized but not named faces is not useless of for me. In this view, you cannot double-click on a face to see to which photo/context it below (often necessary to put a name on face of someone you do not see every day). I would have to add each face from this view to the view of people albums where you can check the associated photo, to either name or hide the face. I do not want to do this, as I would have to hide a lot, and I do not know what the consequences are. In the past hiding a people could hide a photo from memories. I think it is not the case anymore. But as long as Apple doesn&apos;t really know what &quot;hide&quot; is supposed to do, I rather not use it.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>So I will still continue naming faces directly on photos.</p><p>But I won&apos;t use anymore the view of unnamed faces.
